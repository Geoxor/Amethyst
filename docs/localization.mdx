### Getting started

Steps to get started with [localizing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) Amethyst

1. Follow the cloning procedure stated in [Development](/development)
2. Navigate to `src/renderer/locales`
3. Find or create a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Syntax) file for the locale you want to localize for

<Tip>All locales should be named in the [IETF Language Tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) format such as `en-US.json`</Tip>

### Advice

It is expect that certain terminology only makes sense in English, for that reason when localizing try to maintain coherence of meaning in said language

### Testing

All locales should be in the `src/renderer/locales` folder

Amethyst will automatically load and show the locales on the dropdown menu under `Settings` > `Application`

### Synchronizing keys

When updating a locale you might find that there will be missing keys, that happens due to development changes in `en-US.json` since that is the main language Amethyst falls back on

To add the missing keys from `en-US.json` run the following command:
```bash
yarn gen:locales
```
<Note>This command will update all the locales</Note>

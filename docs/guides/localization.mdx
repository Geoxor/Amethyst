## Using crowdin

It is recommended to use Crowdin for doing translations using the following link https://crowdin.com/project/amethyst-player

## Manual localization

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step" icon='github'>
    Follow the cloning procedure stated in [Development](/guides/development)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step" icon='magnifying-glass'>
    Navigate to `src/renderer/locales`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step" icon='file-plus'>
    Find or create a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Syntax) file for the locale you want to localize for
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>All locales should be named in the [IETF Language Tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag) format such as `en-US.json`</Tip>

### Advice

It is expected that certain terminology only makes sense in English, for that reason when localizing try to maintain coherence of meaning in your language even if requires indirect translations or rephrasing

### Testing

All locales should be in the `src/renderer/locales` folder

Amethyst will automatically load and show the locales on the dropdown menu under `Settings` > `Application`

### Synchronizing keys

When updating a locale you might find that there will be missing keys, that happens due to development changes in `en-US.json` since that is the main language Amethyst falls back on

To add the missing keys from `en-US.json` run the following command:
```bash
yarn gen:locales
```
<Note>This command will update all the locales</Note>

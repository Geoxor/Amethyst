### What is it?

Upon loading metadata of a file, Amethyst will create a `.amf` similar to  [Ableton Analysis Files (.asd)](https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/managing-files-and-sets/#analysis-files-asd) to store it's information for faster future access 

### Location

This file is stored in the `Metadata Cache` folder within the [storage folder](/introduction#metadata-location) and it's a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file containing
the metadata of the given audio file. The filename is going to be the same as the name of the audio file it stores metadata for.

eg. `enjoii - Never Say Goodbye.flac` => `enjoii - Never Say Goodbye.flac.amf`

<Note>
If the file is renamed Amethyst will have to re-cache the metadata, creating a new file resulting in orphaned copies of cached files.
</Note>

### Regeneration
These files are generated when Amethyst analyzes a file for metadata. They can be rewritten by forcefully refreshing metadata
within Amethyst from the dropdown menu or with the shortcut `CTRL + ALT + R`.

### Deletion
As mentioned above, all metadata caches are stored in `%appdata%/Amethyst/Metadata Cache`. Simply deleting the files within the folder will achieve cache deletion.

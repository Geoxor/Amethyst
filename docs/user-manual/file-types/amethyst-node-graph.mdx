### What is it?

This is a file that stores the positions, connections, and parameter values for all nodes within a Node Graph.

It's realistically a serialized [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file with a fancy icon and extension; it can be edited with any text editor if you fancy suffering.

<Warning>
It is **not recommended** to manually edit `.ang` files as it may result in crashes and unexpected behavior when loading them
